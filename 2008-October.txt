Dear technicians:

I appreciate your taking the time to review my letter. First I would like to
thank you for your procedures of 'libaran' about fmm. Recently I am
calculating some problems about 3d Electrostatic field, but traditional bem
is very inefficient. so I select the method of fmm to solve the
shortcomings. when I find your procedures, I'm very Excited. Here I still
have some question to ask you. 1.Are there lib of fmm that can be used in
the windows xp? 2. how can I do, if I want to use it in matlab?3.can you
send me the lib of explanations?(if possible ,I want to do some special
calculation on the basis of the lib)

So if you could please send me any relevant information about these
question, I would be grateful.

Thank you for your help in this endeavor.

 

Sincerely,

 
Yifeizhang

Dear Yifeizhang,

Thank you for your interest on Libaran

First, Aran is developped under linux.

Yesterday,I tried to compile it under Cygwin but it doesn't work
because mingw compiler doesn't currently support C99 complex numbers.
It could however compile on another Windows compiler that is able to
compile glib-2.0 (maybe devc++?).

I'll try to fix this C99 complex problem as soon as I have a little time.

Sorry, but I don't know much of usable fmm libraries on WindowsXP...

Using some C library in matlab can be done by making a wrapper module
with a specific tool. I don't know much about this myself. Maybe you
could even try to use some wrapper generator like SWIG
(http://www.swig.org) to generate a Java wrapper: I heard that matlab
can execute Java code.

If you want some explanations, you can look at the online
documentation: API reference
(http://www.libaran.org/docs/api/html/index.html) and a short document
about 3D impelentation
(http://www.libaran.org/docs/notes/development3d.pdf).

I'll be very happy to try to help you if you have further questions.

Best regards,

Pierre Gay

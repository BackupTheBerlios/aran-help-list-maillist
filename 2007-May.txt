Subject: [Aran-help-list] Can I develop micromagnetic field computing using
	Aran?
Message-ID: <4658C4CA.5090607@cs.man.ac.uk>

Hi,


I am a master student currently doing a project and considering using 
this Aran to develop a programme to simulate 3d micromagnetic field 
computing with FMM. Can this library really help? Does anyone have the 
experience and please give some suggestions? Thanks.


regards,


Xin
